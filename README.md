# Project-2
The purpose of this project is to explore how mobility data affects the reproduction rate of COVID-19. The reproduction rate refers to the predicted number of people that any given infected person will infect, and mobility is the population's average movement. Simple multi-linear regression was used to try and find these relationships.
